	My assignment was to create a program that would run a loop while the user enters questions into a console that would simulate a chat bot for a chosen representative. Both because of I hadn’t actually fully completed project program 2 and ease of use I put all the values into a representative class that stores the information that will be answered by the chat bot. The program starts by making a string that would hold the question input from the user, then a buffered reader is created to read the console input to put into the string question. After that, a representative object is made and all values are put into it. In the full project, the values would instead be obtained by having the program read from a .txt file. Then, the program enters a do while loop in a try and catch tree on the condition that the string question does not equal exit or q, ignoring the case of it. The console asks the user for a question and that answer is put made the value of string question. After that, the program checks the string question to see if it contains certain keywords. This was done to address all the ways a question could be phrased, although it could lead to strange results depending on the question. The program checks for the keywords: name, region, district, personal phone, live, contact, committee, committees, service, and the phrase tell me everything. If none of the keywords are detected than the program outputs that it does not know this information. Otherwise, it gives answers based on the keyword. For example, name makes the program answer what the representative’s name is. In the event of an exception, the program will tell the user that an error has occurred and end itself. The program will end normally if the word exit or letter q is the value for string question.
