• Language of choice: Any from the three (C++, Java, Python)
• Program should do the following:
• Take input from a local file with whose content is obtained from Prog#1
(when district name given as input)
• Given an information type as input, the program will return its content
• Examples: Contact Information, personal information, voting records
• Input type can be given as command line argument.
Examples:
• prog2processor –t “Contact Information”
• prog2processor –t “Contact Information:name” // Get person’s name
• For demonstrating that your program works, have a file called
“test_output.txt” showing the set of supported commandline options
and output in the doc folder.
Code organization
• Create a folder in your GitHub called “prog2-processor”
• Have sub-folders: src (or code), data, doc, test
• Write a 1-page report in ./doc sub-folder
• Send a confirmation that code is done to instructor and TA, and update Google sheet
