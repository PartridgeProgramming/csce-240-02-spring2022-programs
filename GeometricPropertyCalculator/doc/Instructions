 Write a program called GeometricPropertyCalculator.
• The program reads an input file (called input.txt). Each line in the file contains dimensions of a geometric
shape – rectangle, shape and triangle. Specifically:
• For rectangle, it contains – RECTANGLE <length-in-cm> <breadth-in-cm>
• For circle, it contains – CIRCLE <radius-in-cm>
• For triangle, it contains – TRIANGLE <side-1-in-cm> <side-2-in-cm> <side-3-in-cm>
• The user specifies the property to calculate as argument to the program: 1 for AREA and 2 for PERIMETER
• The program writes output lines to an output file (called output.txt) for each shape that it reads and the
property – AREA or PERIMETER.

For example, for RECTANGLE and property as AREA, the program should write – RECTANGLE AREA <calculated value>
• Write GeometricPropertyCalculator in C++
• It should support RECTANGLE, CIRCLE and TRIANGLE
• It should support properties AREA and PERIMETER
• If there is insufficient information, the program should give an error. E.g. TRIANGLE AREA “Not enough information to calculate”

Code guidelines
• Have sub-directories in your folder
• src sub-folder, (or code) for code
• data sub-folder, for input.txt and output.txt
• doc sub-folder, for documentation on what the code does or sample output

Hint
• Area
• Rectangle: length x breadth
• Circle: pi * r^2
• Triangle: -
• Perimeter
• Rectangle: 2 * (length + breadth)
• Circle: 2 * pi * r
• Triangle: sum of sides
