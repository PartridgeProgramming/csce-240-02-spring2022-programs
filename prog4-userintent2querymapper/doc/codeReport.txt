	My assignment was to create a program that would be able to handle any user query and give an answer based on how close it is to known user query. My program has two classes, Representative and the main class. The representative class is used to store the values of the representative and contains some minor methods to help with the main. Namely the getContactInfo method which gives the contact info and the getAllInfo method which displays every value that the representative class holds. In the main class it starts by making a string that will represent the query and an integer called “responseCode” that’ll be used later in the program to determine which output to use. A bufferedReader is made to read the user input and a representative object is made which holds all the values. In the completed project program 2 would be used to input the values for the object. After the object has been initialized, a vector is made and then the program will enter a do while loop and then a try and catch block. In the try block, the vector is reset and the console asks the user for a question, which it will take as a string. Then, that question is split by the regex for empty space and made into a string array. Then, in a for loop the contents of the array are put into the vector. Afterwards, the program will execute a method to find the right response code. It does so by going through each part of the vector and comparing it to an array which has the known questions split up by word. If enough of the words match, the method will return a number that corresponds to the question which will be used in the main to find out what to display in the console. In the event of an exception, the program will print in the console that an error has occurred and print out the error message before exiting the program.
